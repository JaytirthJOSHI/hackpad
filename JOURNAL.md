## 11/2/2025 - Kicad set up   

This is my first time ever writing with a Kicad spent most of my time creating a setup and setting up the wiring for my PCB. It is complete now. I'm attaching a photo below. I tried to do my best to follow the guide for the HackPad. I know that we're not supposed to follow a tutorial one-to-one, and I didn't exactly do that. But to be honest, I did follow it a fair bit sorry :( ![Screenshot 2025-11-02 at 12.45.59 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzY0NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4a068d903f429cc83964c27a7aa8fd8ac3545770/Screenshot%202025-11-02%20at%2012.45.59%E2%80%AFAM.png)

## 11/8/2025 - Made a v2 of pcb bc im a bum and broke it lmao + KLE  

Okay, so I redid the PCB, and then also made the keyboard layout for my HackPad. Before I was following the tutorial from Highway, and now that the tutorial is in Blueprint, there were some small changes. I also implemented those just to make sure that this goes well :)![Screenshot 2025-11-08 at 10.23.07 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTY1MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ccbe9cfc2a696661aa3f72a8f7ab75221dd048c7/Screenshot%202025-11-08%20at%2010.23.07%E2%80%AFPM.png)![Screenshot 2025-11-08 at 10.23.20 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTY1MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0411db3cb491a8cf9444d78454275942b6a41768/Screenshot%202025-11-08%20at%2010.23.20%E2%80%AFPM.png)

  

## 11/9/2025 1:39 PM - Made a CAD design and set it all up  

I made a CAD illustration on my Fusion 360, and then, you know, make sure that the PCB was right because it apparently was off a little bit. So I had to resize it in the PCB so that it fit my CAD illustration size. And now it's all set up. I'm attaching screenshots of the top and the case.
