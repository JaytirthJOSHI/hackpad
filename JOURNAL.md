## 11/2/2025 - Kicad set up   

This is my first time ever writing with a Kicad spent most of my time creating a setup and setting up the wiring for my PCB. It is complete now. I'm attaching a photo below. I tried to do my best to follow the guide for the HackPad. I know that we're not supposed to follow a tutorial one-to-one, and I didn't exactly do that. But to be honest, I did follow it a fair bit sorry :( ![Screenshot 2025-11-02 at 12.45.59 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzY0NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4a068d903f429cc83964c27a7aa8fd8ac3545770/Screenshot%202025-11-02%20at%2012.45.59%E2%80%AFAM.png)
